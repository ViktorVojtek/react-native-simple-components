# react-native-simple-components

This package contains a collection of customizable and reusable UI components built with React on top of React Native components.
These components are designed to be easy to use, highly flexible and allowing you to quickly and easily build beautiful user interfaces for your projects.

This package inherits react native components such as buttons, spinner, text, scrollview, and [more](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis).
Each component is just a react native component with enhanced [style props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props), to directly style a component via props.
This approuch could lead to increased development speed when building UI.

I hope you find this components package useful in your projects.
If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for using this package!
